*Description:-

*Introduction of Python:-
                      - python is a high level , easy to learn programming language that is widely used in Data science .
- Python have easy to Write & Read Syntax.
- Python have large no.of labraries.
-Strong communication Supports.

*Why Python For Data Science:-
                           -In Data Science Python is Used to collect,clean,analyze,visualize and help to predict data.
-It's used Labraries like 
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotib
Scikit-learn

# Variaables and DataTypes :-
                            - Variables are containers for storing data values.
                            - You donâ€™t need to declare the type; Python automatically understands it.
                            - python variables are case sensitive.
                            - pyhton allow assinging values to multiple variables in a single line.
*Example:-
x = 10 ----> x is name of the variable and 10 is value store in x variable.

*Datatype :-
x = " hello " ----> String
y = 10  -----> integer
z = 3.4 -----> float
a = True ----> Boolean
b = 1+2j ----> Complex

*Pyhton-TypeCasting:-
                   -Type Casting in Python refers to the process of converting the data type of a variable from one type to another, such as from a string to an integer, a float to an integer, etc.

# Data Structure in pyhton :-

*Data Type :-
                -User or Developer define only one value.
*Data Structure :-
                 -User or Developer can define more than one values.
*Matrix :-
          -tables(rows and columns )
^^^^^^
matrix = collection of data structures .
data structure = collection of data types.

^^^^^
#python Data Structure are devided into 2 types :-
                                                 1) Inbuild DS :- List , Tuples , Set , Dict .
                                                 2) User def DS :- Stack, Linkedlist , Heap , Tree , ( normally used by some labraries ).


^^^^^^
# Inbuild Data Structure
1) List :-
         - List is Growable.
         - List define with []
         - Duplicates are allowed.
         - Multiple datatypes can declare.
         - List is Mutable (you can change values).

* Methods of List :-
1) append() :-
- It's a build in method in pyhton used to add an item to the end of a list.
2) copy() :-
- copy() is a built-in method used to create a shallow copy of a list.
3) Count() :-
- count() returns the number of times a specific value appears in a list.
4) pop() :-
- pop() removes and returns an element from a list by index; if no index is given, it removes the last item.
5) remove() :-
- remove() deletes the first occurrence of a specified value from the list (does not return it).
6) Difference Between pop() and remove():-
- pop(index) removes and returns an item by index.
- remove(value) deletes the first matching value (does not return it).
7) insert():-
- insert(index, value) adds a value at the specified index in the list without replacing existing elements.
8) extned():-
-extend() adds each element from another list to the end of the current list.
9) reverse() :-
- reverse() reverses the elements of the list in place (modifies the original list).
10) sort() :-
- sort() arranges the elements of a list in ascending (default) or descending order.
11) clear() :-
- clear() removes all elements from the list, making it an empty list.
12) del listname :-
- del deletes the entire list from memory (not just its contents).
13) len() :-
- len() returns the total number of items in a list.

^^^^^
#pyhton indexing :-
- pyhton index begins with 0 .
- index can be divided into 3 part.
1) forword indexing -- left to right.
2) backword indexing -- right to left.
3) step indexing -- every step count jumpes.

^^^^^
#Tuple :-

-Tuple is an ordered collection of elements.
-Tuple are immutable.
-Once created, you cannot change its values.
ex----> tup1 = (1,2,3,4,"rehan") # tuple

ğŸ”¹ Only 2 Built-in Tuple Methods:
1) count(x)	:-
-Counts how many times x appears	
2)index(x) :-
-Returns the first index where x is located	.
