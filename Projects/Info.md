## 📘 Project 2: Salary Prediction Web App (with Streamlit)

An end-to-end ML project that predicts salary from years of experience using Simple Linear Regression. I deployed this model into an interactive web interface using Streamlit and connected it with a pickled backend model.

**Highlights:**
- Model training, evaluation, and pickling
- Real-time prediction using Streamlit UI
- Manual and library-based metric validation (R², SSE, SSR, etc.)

**Tech Stack:** Python · Pandas · Scikit-learn · Streamlit · Pickle · Matplotlib
