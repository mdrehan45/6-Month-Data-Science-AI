## 📘 Project 2: Salary Prediction Web App (with Streamlit)

An end-to-end ML project that predicts salary from years of experience using Simple Linear Regression. I deployed this model into an interactive web interface using Streamlit and connected it with a pickled backend model.

**Highlights:**
- Model training, evaluation, and pickling
- Real-time prediction using Streamlit UI
- Manual and library-based metric validation (R², SSE, SSR, etc.)

**Tech Stack:** Python · Pandas · Scikit-learn · Streamlit · Pickle · Matplotlib

- Webhook support for real-time communication
- Fully customizable automation logic
  
  # 🎯 Student Marks Predictor – End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This is an **end-to-end Machine Learning project** that predicts students' marks based on the number of study hours.  
The project aims to help a university analyze whether increasing study hours actually improves students' academic performance using their historical data.

The model is deployed as a **Flask web application** where users can input study hours and instantly get a predicted score.  
Additionally, all user inputs are stored in a CSV file for future analysis.
