# What is Statistics?

## Definition
**Statistics** is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data to make informed decisions or draw meaningful conclusions in the face of uncertainty.

## Types of Statistics

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- **Purpose**: Summarize and describe features of a dataset.
- **Tools**:
  - Measures of Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode)
  - Measures of Dispersion (Variance, Standard Deviation, Range)
  - Data Visualization (Histograms, Box Plots, Scatter Plots)

### 2. Inferential Statistics
- **Purpose**: Make predictions or generalizations about a population based on sample data.
- **Tools**:
  - Hypothesis Testing (t-tests, ANOVA)
  - Confidence Intervals
  - Regression Analysis

## Why is Statistics Important?
1. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Empowers businesses, governments, and researchers to base choices on evidence.
2. **AI/ML Foundation**: Critical for training models, evaluating performance (e.g., accuracy, precision).
3. **Risk Assessment**: Quantifies uncertainty (e.g., probability in finance, healthcare).

# Population vs Sample

## 1. Population
- **Definition**: The complete set of all individuals, items, or data points of interest in a study.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Often too large to measure entirely (e.g., all humans, all trees in a forest).
  - Described by **parameters** (fixed numerical values, usually unknown).
- **Examples**:
  - All smartphones sold in 2024.
  - Every student enrolled at Harvard University.

## 2. Sample
- **Definition**: A subset of the population, selected for actual data collection.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Used to **estimate** population parameters (via statistics).
  - Must be **representative** (avoid bias) and **random**.
- **Examples**:
  - 1,000 smartphone users surveyed about battery life.
  - 200 Harvard students' GPAs analyzed.
### Why Sampling?
1. **Cost-Effective**: Cheaper than surveying entire populations.
2. **Time-Saving**: Faster data collection.
3. **Practicality**: Some populations are infinite (e.g., all possible website visits).

# Types of Data in Statistics

## 1. Qualitative (Categorical) Data
**Definition**: Non-numerical data representing categories or labels.

### Subtypes:
- **Nominal Data**: 
  - No inherent order.
  - Examples: 
    - Gender (Male/Female/Other)
    - Colors (Red, Blue, Green)
- **Ordinal Data**:
  - Ordered categories but intervals are uneven.
  - Examples:
    - Survey ratings (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent)
    - Education level (High School, Bachelor's, PhD)

## 2. Quantitative (Numerical) Data
**Definition**: Numerical data that can be measured.

### Subtypes:
- **Discrete Data**:
  - Countable, finite values (often integers).
  - Examples:
    - Number of students in a class
    - Cars in a parking lot
- **Continuous Data**:
  - Infinite possible values (measurements).
  - Examples:
    - Height/Weight
    - Temperature
