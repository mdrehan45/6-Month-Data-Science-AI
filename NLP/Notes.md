# What is NLP :-
        - NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. It combines linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to process text or speech, powering applications like chatbots, voice assistants, translation tools, sentiment analysis, and text summarization. NLP includes tasks like Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for extracting meaning and intent, and Natural Language Generation (NLG) for creating human-like responses. In short, NLP is the technology that allows machines to “read,” “listen,” and “speak” in our language.
# Applications of NLP include:  
    - Machine Translation – translating languages (e.g., Google Translate).
    - Chatbots & Virtual Assistants – Alexa, Siri, customer support bots.
    - Sentiment Analysis – understanding opinions in social media or reviews.
    - Text Summarization – generating short summaries of long documents.
    - Speech Recognition – converting speech to text (ASR).
    - Text-to-Speech – reading text aloud (TTS).
    - Spam Detection – filtering unwanted emails.
    - Search Engines – understanding queries to show relevant results.
    - Named Entity Recognition (NER) – extracting names, places, and dates from text.
    - Question Answering Systems – directly answering questions from text or data.
In short, NLP is applied wherever machines need to understand or generate human language.
# Components of NLP can be grouped into three main parts:
### Natural Language Understanding (NLU) – Helps machines understand meaning, intent, and context in human language.
    - Tasks: Tokenization, Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, intent detection.
### Natural Language Generation (NLG) – Creates human-like text or speech from data or information.
    - Tasks: Text summarization, chatbot responses, report generation, translation.
    - Text Preprocessing – Cleans and prepares raw text for analysis.
    - Tasks: Stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging.
Some NLP systems also include Speech Processing (speech-to-text, text-to-speech) as an
